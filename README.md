# Telegram Bot on Cloudflare Workers

A minimal example of a Telegram Bot running on a Cloudflare Worker.

## Setup:

1. Get your new bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather): https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather
2. Sign up to Cloudflare Workers: https://workers.cloudflare.com/
3. In the Cloudflare Dashboard go to "Workers", then click "Create application" and then "Create worker"
4. Choose a name and click "Deploy" to create the worker
5. Click on "Configure worker" -> "Settings" -> "Variables"
6. Add a new variable with the name `BOT_TOKEN` and the value of your bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
7. Add a new variable with the name `SECRET_PATH` and set the value to a random secret. See https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook
8. Click on "Quick Edit" to change the source code of your new worker
9. Copy and paste the code from [worker.js](worker.js) into the editor
10. Optional: Change the `WEBHOOK` variable to a different path. See https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook
11. Click on "Save and Deploy"
12. In the middle panel append `/registerWebhook` to the url. For example: https://my-worker-123.username.workers.dev/registerWebhook
13. Click "Send". In the right panel should appear `Ok`. If 401 Unauthorized appears, you may have used a wrong bot token.
14. That's it, now you can send a text message to your Telegram bot
